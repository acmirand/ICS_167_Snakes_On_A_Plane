[----Milestone 1 log----]
Contributions mostly identified as commits on the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/acmirand/ICS_167_Snakes_On_A_Plane

However the group had 2 meetings (1/27/17 and 2/1/17) where we all worked on
the code together but only one person was doing the commits. Both meetings were
attended by everyone in the group.
