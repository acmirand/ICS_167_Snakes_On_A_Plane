However the group had 2 meetings (1/27/17 and 2/1/17) where we all worked on
the code together but only one person was doing the commits. Both meetings were
attended by everyone in the group.

Work breakdown:
Al - reference guy for the game logic since he wrote the javascript-version of
     the game, helped debug the game loop on the server end

       translate those messages into the server
Daniel - worked on setting up the game loop, managed snake and wall collisions,
         snake growing updates and resets
Ney - worked on the display-side, getting food and scores to update, and
